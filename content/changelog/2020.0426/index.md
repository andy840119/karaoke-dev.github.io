## Achievement
- \First post/

## Blog
- `This post` is the initial post in this progress blog.
- Define how to update the latest progress (What's new should be listed like the official changelog.)
- Will create `1` new record for each one or two months, if I don't forget >_>
- Changelog will be available to view `in lazer`.

## Editor
- Start making lyric maker into the editor. [karaoke](#69@andy840119)    
    In the future, users can select to import `.lrc` created by another tool like [RhythmKaTTE](http://juna-idler.blogspot.com/2016/05/rhythmkatte-version-01.html), or just create complex time tag in the editor.


## Testing
- Trying to `clean-up` test cases.
